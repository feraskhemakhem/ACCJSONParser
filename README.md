# ACCJSONParser
JSON Parser specific for file types used in Aggie Coding Club project organizing. Additional features include a Slack bot that creates channels and adds members to them given the output JSON.


Note: in order to run, the JSON loaded must have the following parameters per member: Name, Email, Slack

Further development will allow more dynamic application.
